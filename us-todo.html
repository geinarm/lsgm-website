    Here are some places that we love and hope you will too!  Please ask us if you have questions!  They are not all in Williamsport, but depending on how long you are here you may want to explore the area.
    </p>

    <h3>Williamsport, MD (near the venue)</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.hagerstownmd.org/index.aspx?NID=308"><b>Hagerstown City Park</b></a>
        <br/>
        This park is gorgeous. There are tons of little paths to walk as well as a lake filled with hungry fish and ducks.  They would love if you brought them a snack and stopped by for an afternoon visit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/hagerstown"><b>Hagerstown Outlets</b></a>
        <br/>
        Tons of great stores and great prices.  The Columbia Outlet store is one of our favorites.

    <h3>Baltimore Area</h3>
    <div>
      If you fly into BWI you may want to spend some time in the surrounding area.
      
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.bengies.com"><b>Bengies Drive-in</b></a>
        <br/>
        AMAZING, old school drive-in.  They have kept so much from the 50s you feel like you are stepping back in time.  Arrive EARLY!  There gets to be a line.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.aqua.org"><b>Baltimore Aquarium</b></a>
        <br/>
        Awesome aquarium, one of Lauren’s all time favorite places.

    <h3>Washington DC Area</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        If you are flying into Dulles or Reagan or just staying with friends in the city here are some ideas.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.si.edu"><b>Smithsonian</b></a>
        <br/>
        Air and Space and Natural History are our favorites.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu"><b>National Zoo</b></a>
        <br/>
        Go say hi to the pandas!
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/visit"><b>Dulles Air and Space</b></a>
        <br/>
        This is a second air and space museum out by the airport.  It’s an actual hanger full of planes and space shuttles. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.mediumrarerestaurant.com"><b>Medium Rare</b></a>
        <br/>
        Guðjón’s favorite restaurant.  Steak frites...perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.silverdiner.com"><b>Silver Diner</b></a>
        <br/>
        Silver Diner  There are several of these in the area.  It’s your classic diner and then some.  They have great crab chowder and crab cakes.  You are in Maryland, you should probably eat some crab.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/lancaster-county-dutch-market-germantown"><b>Lancaster County Dutch Market</b></a>
        <br/>
        Kind of out of town but you pass near by to and from the venue.  Check the hours as they are kind of weird, but you can get some pretty amazing food.
      </p>

      <h3>Shenandoah Area</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.nps.gov/shen/index.htm"><b>Shenandoah National Park</b></a>
          <br/>
          This is definitely a hike but if you are looking to make a mini vacation out of your visit, Shenandoah is pretty spectacular.  Cabins, camping, hikes, horses or wine tasting.  There is something for everyone!
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="http://www.visitskylinedrive.org/Home.aspx"><b>Skyline Drive</b></a>
          <br/>
          This drive cuts through the park, it's slow moving but absolutely gorgeous.  
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="http://luraycaverns.com"><b>Luray Caverns</b></a>
