                <b>Lauren Laree Shetler</b> 
                grew up in a small rural town in Pennsylvania, United States.  She studied Biology and Economics at Muhlenberg College.  Lauren had a brief period of using her science education for research, but quickly realized that she was meant to be a teacher.  After earning her Masters in Education, Lauren moved to the Washington, DC area to teach at the Academy of the Holy Cross.  Last year with Guðjón’s support she made the transition to public school.  Lauren is now teaching Biology and Environmental Science at Gaithersburg High School.

                <b>Guðjón Einar Magnusson</b> 
                grew up at the edge of the arctic circle, in the small town of Isafjordur, Iceland. He moved to Reykjavík to study animation and graphic design, but as time moved on he slowly transitioned away from the artistic side to the technical, first to computer games and eventually to computer science. While studying computer science at Reykjavik University he got the opportunity to spend a semester abroad and intern at a research center in Maryland in the fall of 2013.

            <b>They met</b>
            about halfway through Guðjóns six month internship.  They had their first date over coffee at Kramerbooks in Washington DC.  The famously picky Lauren was immediately drawn to Guðjón.  A week later they had their second date kayaking on the Potomac.  The date ended up lasting all day.  Lauren knew she had found something special in Guðjón. He seemed to enjoy her talking nonstop about her students and the various organisms they encountered during their day outside.They quickly became close, she was the best tour guide he could have asked for. When it came time to go home he was not ready to say goodbye.

            The two spent eight months apart.  However, Lauren did visit twice and they spoke daily.  (Thank you Skype!)  Finally in August 2014 Guðjón obtained a Visa and returned to the states to become a graduate student at University of Maryland.  Guðjón moved in and they began their lives together.  Guðjón and Lauren love to travel and enjoy the outdoors.  Whether it's kayaking with otters in Monterey Bay or hiking over mountains in the Westfjords.

            <b>The Proposal</b>
            happened on a hot July day, at the end of weekend camping trip in Cunningham Falls State Park. Guðjón bought the ring earlier that week and took it on the trip hoping to find the perfect time and place to pop the question. The whole weekend he kept moving the ring from one hiding spot to another, always keeping it close but out of sight. At one point the ring was under Lauren’s pillow while she slept. Finally on the last day of the trip, while hiking through the woods, it was clear that it was now or never. That morning over breakfast Lauren had commented in how perfect the weekend had been, and that she loved being outside with Guðjón.  While Lauren was distracted catching pokemon on her phone. Guðjón lead her off the path to a small cliff and pulled the ring out of her backpack. She said yes! And she caught her first Nidoran.
