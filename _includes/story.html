                <b>Lauren Laree Shetler</b> 
                grew up in a small rural town in Pennsylvania, United States.  She fell in love with biology and dance at a young age.  After high school, Lauren studied Biology and Economics at Muhlenberg College.  Muhlenberg gave her the gift of many amazing friendships as well as the opportunity to continue to tap dance.  Muhlenberg was also where Lauren first taught, while running after school theater programs in the Allentown community.  Lauren had a brief period of using her science education for research, but quickly realized that she was meant to be a teacher.  After earning her Masters in Education, Lauren moved to the Washington, DC area to teach at the Academy of the Holy Cross.  During her five years teaching at the academy she taught biology, chemistry and environmental science.  She is most proud however of the Pom and Cheer team which she founded and coached.  Last year with Guðjón’s support she made the transition to public school  Lauren is now teaching Biology and Environmental Science at Gaithersburg High School.

                <b>Guðjón Einar Magnusson</b> 
                grew up at the edge of the arctic circle, in a small town in Iceland. He moved to Reykjavík to study animation and graphic design, but as time moved on he slowly transitioned away from the artistic side to the technical, first to computer games and eventually to computer science.
                While studying computer science at Reykjavik University he go the opportunity to spend a semester abroad and intern at a research center in Maryland. About half way through his 6 month internship he met Lauren and they quickly became close, she was the best tour guide he could have asked for. When it came time to go home he was not ready to say goodbye. In 2015 he moved back to the US become a graduate student at University of Maryland.

            <b>We Met</b> 
            in the fall of 2013, Lauren was teaching at AHC and Guðjón was interning at Fraunhofer.  They met and had their first date over coffee at Kramerbooks in Washington DC.  The famously picky Lauren was immediately drawn to Guðjón.  She had to keep their date short, however, because she had concert tickets for that night.  A week later they had their second date kayaking on the Potomac.  The date ended up lasting all day.  Lauren knew she had found something special in Guðjón. He seemed to enjoy her talking nonstop about her students and the various organisms they encountered during their day outside.

            After his internship Guðjón had to return to Iceland to finish his degree at Reykjavik University.  The two spent eight months a part.  However, Lauren did visit twice and they spoke daily.  (Thank you Skype!)  Finally in August 2014 Guðjón obtained a Visa and returned to the states.  Guðjón moved in and they began their lives together.  Guðjón and Lauren love to travel and enjoy the outdoors together.  Whether it's kayaking with otters in Monterey Bay or hiking over mountains in the Westfjords.
