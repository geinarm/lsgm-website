        <h3>Flying to Iceland</h3>
        <p>
          We would recommend booking your tickets through <a href="http://www.icelandair.us">Iceland Air</a> or <a href="http://wowair.us">Wow Air</a>. Iceland Air is amazing and is never a bad choice. If you book early (like yesterday) you can get a good price and they give you two free checked bags. If you are booking your trip a little later Wow Air might be the good choice. It can be cheaper because it is a no frills airline but you have to be aware of what you are and are not getting.

          The international airport in Iceland is in Keflavik.  It is a 40 minute drive from the domestic airport in Reykjavik.  You can take a bus or a cab between airports if you are flying straight to Isafjordur.  It may also be a good choice to make some time to hang out in Reykjavik before heading north

        <h3>Travel to Ísafjörður</h3>
        <p>
          To get from Reykjavík to Ísafjörður there are two options, a 5 hour drive through the country side, or a 40 minute flight over the mountains.

        <p>
          For domestic flights in Iceland you only have one option, <a href="https://www.airiceland.is/">Air Iceland</a>. The flight is quick and easy, there is no security line. Fun fact, the airport in Ísafjörður is apparently one of the <a href="http://grapevine.is/news/2015/02/03/the-approach-to-isafjordur-airport-is-extremely-shareable/">most challenging in the world</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to drive you have all the normal rental car options, I like to use <a href="http://www.rentalcars.com/en/">rentalcars.com</a> to find a car. Make sure to get the car at the right airport, international flights land in Keflavík (KEF).
          <br/>
          Keep in mind that the roads in Iceland do not compare to the highways in the US, especially as you get further away from the capital. There should not be any snow in July, and we do have pavement all the way (that's a recent development).
