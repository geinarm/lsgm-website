    Here are some places that we love and hope you will too!  Please ask us if you have questions!
    </p>

    <h3>Ísafjörður (near the venue)</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.westfjords.is/en/what-to-see-and-do/services/tjoruhusid"><b>Tjöruhúsið</b></a>
      <br/>
      One of the oldest houses in Ísafjörður that has been transformed into a restaurant. Best seafood buffet anywhere, ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.nedsti.is/nedstikaupstadur/"><b>Neðstikaupstaður</b></a>
      <br/>
      The oldest remaining house in town has been made into a museum that shows what life was like as a fisherman in Iceland in the 1700s.

      <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189967-d4334002-Reviews-Husid-Isafjordur_Westfjords_Region.html"><b>Húsið</b></a>
    </p>

    <h3>Reykjavík Area</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://expertvagabond.com/golden-circle-iceland/"><b>Golden Circle</b></a>
      <br/>
      All the Icelandic postcard locations in one quick drive.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.bluelagoon.is/"><b>Blue Lagoon</b></a>
      <br/>
      The blue lagoon is a must for anyone traveling to Iceland. Its a giant, blue swimming pool located in the middle of a lava field just outside of Reykjavík. 
      <br/>
      Some people are uncomfortable with the <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/history-culture/getting-naked-in-iceland">casual nakedness</a> on display in Icelandic swimming pools.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.bbp.is/information-in-english"><b>Pylsa</b></a>
      <br/>
      From the mightiest king to the loneliest peasant, every one enjoys an Icelandic hot dog.
