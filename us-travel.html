    <h3>Airports: So many choices!</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport">Dulles International Airport</a>: 80 minutes from venue
      <br/>
      <a href="http://www.bwiairport.com/en">BWI</a>: 80 minutes from venue
      <br/>
      <a href="http://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport">Reagan National Airport</a>: 80 minutes from venue
      <br/>
      <a href="http://www.flyhia.com">Harrisburg International Airport</a>: 90 minutes from venue
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Pro Tip:</b> When booking flights use the the airport code WAS to search Dulles, Reagan and BWI simultaneously.  You will have to to search for Harrisburg flights separately.

    <h3>Flying from Iceland</h3>
    <p>
    We would recommend booking your tickets through <a href="http://www.icelandair.us">Iceland Air</a> or <a href="http://wowair.us">Wow Air</a>. Iceland Air is amazing and is never a bad choice. If you book early (like yesterday) you can get a good price and they give you two free checked bags. (You know you want to go outlet shopping when you are here!) If you are booking your trip a little later Wow Air might be the good choice. It can be cheaper because it is a no frills airline but you have to be aware of what you are and are not getting.

    <h3>Getting to Venue</h3>
    <p>
    To be honest your life will be easier if you or someone you know has a car. However it would be possible for you to use <a href="http://www.supershuttle.com">Super Shuttles</a> and <a href="www.uber.com">Uber</a> to get around.  Once you make it to Williamsport everything is really close.  
    </p>

    <h3>Car Rentals</h3>
    <p>
    <a href="www.cheaptickets.com">Cheap Tickets</a> is a great place to book a car. Lauren swears by it. If you are booking a domestic flight do it through cheap tickets and get the car at the same time.  Way easier.  
    </p>

    <h3>Budget Tip</h3>
    <p>
    <a href="www.megabus.com">Megabus</a>, <a href="www.boltbus.com">Bolt Bus</a> and <a href="www.vamoosebus.com">Vamoose Bus</a> are great options to get you to the DC area on the cheap. You can also look into <a href="https://mta.maryland.gov/marc-train">MARC trains</a> which go up to Williamsport. But, just ask us or call someone you know and hitch a ride, it's probably easier.
