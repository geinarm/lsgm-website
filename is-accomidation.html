		<h3>Hotels</h3>
		<p>
			There are not many hotels in Ísafjörður, and in the summer they tend to fill up. If you want to get a hotel room you should do that early.

		<h3>Airbnb</h3>
		<p>
			In Ísafjörður, Airbnb might be your best option. You can find many places in downtown Ísafjörður and in neighboring towns, just don't go too far away unless you plan to have a car. Public transit is limited and there is no Uber.
